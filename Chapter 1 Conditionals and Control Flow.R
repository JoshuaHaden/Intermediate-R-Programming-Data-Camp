###Chapter 1 Conditionals And Control Flow

###Equality
# Comparison of logicals
TRUE == FALSE

# Comparison of numerics
-6 * 14 != 17 - 101

# Comparison of character strings
"useR" == "user"

# Compare a logical with a numeric
TRUE == 1

###Greater And Less Than
# Comparison of numerics
-6*5+2 >= -10+1

# Comparison of character strings
"raining" <= "raining dogs"

# Comparison of logicals
TRUE > FALSE

###Compare Vectors
# The linkedin and facebook vectors have already been created for you
linkedin <- c(16, 9, 13, 5, 2, 17, 14)
facebook <- c(17, 7, 5, 16, 8, 13, 14)

# Popular days
linkedin > 15

# Quiet days
linkedin <= 5

# LinkedIn more popular than Facebook
linkedin > facebook

###Compare Matrices
# The social data has been created for you
linkedin <- c(16, 9, 13, 5, 2, 17, 14)
facebook <- c(17, 7, 5, 16, 8, 13, 14)
views <- matrix(c(linkedin, facebook), nrow = 2, byrow = TRUE)

# When does views equal 13?
views == 13

# When is views less than or equal to 14?
views <= 14

# How often does facebook equal or exceed linkedin times two?
sum(facebook >= linkedin * 2)

###& And |
# The linkedin and last variable are already defined for you
linkedin <- c(16, 9, 13, 5, 2, 17, 14)
last <- tail(linkedin, 1)

# Is last under 5 or above 10?
last<5 | last>10

# Is last between 15 (exclusive) and 20 (inclusive)?
last>15 & last<=20

# Is last between 0 and 5 or between 10 and 15?
(last > 0 & last < 5) | (last > 10 & last < 15)

###& And | (2)
# The social data (linkedin, facebook, views) has been created for you

# linkedin exceeds 10 but facebook below 10
linkedin>10 & facebook<10

# When were one or both visited at least 12 times?
linkedin>=12 | facebook>=12

# When is views between 11 (exclusive) and 14 (inclusive)?
views>11 & views<=14

###Reverse The Result: !
x <- 5
y <- 7
!(!(x < 4) & !!!(y > 12))

###Blend It All Together
# li_df is pre-loaded in Data Camp's workspace

# Select the second column, named day2, from li_df: second
second <- li_df$day2

# Build a logical vector, TRUE if value in second is extreme: extremes
extremes <- second > 25 | second < 5

# Count the number of TRUEs in extremes
sum(extremes)

# Solve it with a one-liner
sum(li_df$day2 > 25 | li_df$day2 < 5)

###The If Statement
# Variables related to your last day of recordings
medium <- "LinkedIn"
num_views <- 14

# Examine the if statement for medium
if (medium == "LinkedIn") {
  print("Showing LinkedIn information")
}

# Write the if statement for num_views
if (num_views>15) {
  print("You're popular!")
}

###Add An Else
# Variables related to your last day of recordings
medium <- "LinkedIn"
num_views <- 14

# Control structure for medium
if (medium == "LinkedIn") {
  print("Showing LinkedIn information")
} else {
  print("Unknown medium")
}

# Control structure for num_views
if (num_views > 15) {
  print("You're popular!")
} else {
  print("Try to be more visible!")
}

###Customize Further: Else If
# Variables related to your last day of recordings
medium <- "LinkedIn"
num_views <- 14

# Control structure for medium
if (medium == "LinkedIn") {
  print("Showing LinkedIn information")
} else if (medium == "Facebook") {
  print("Showing Facebook information")
} else {
  print("Unknown medium")
}

# Control structure for num_views
if (num_views > 15) {
  print("You're popular!")
} else if (num_views <= 15 & num_views > 10) {
  print("Your number of views is average")
} else {
  print("Try to be more visible!")
}

###Else If 2.0
#1.
number <- 6
#2.
number <- 100
#3.
number <- 4
#4.
number <- 2500
if (number < 10) {
  if (number < 5) {
    result <- "extra small"
  } else {
    result <- "small"
  }
} else if (number < 100) {
  result <- "medium"
} else {
  result <- "large"
}
print(result)

###Take Control!
# Variables related to your last day of recordings
li <- 15
fb <- 9

# Code the control-flow construct
if (li >= 15 & fb >= 15) {
  sms <- 2 * (li + fb)
} else if (li < 10 & fb < 10) {
  sms <- 0.5 * (li + fb)
} else {
  sms <- li + fb
}

# Print the resulting sms to the console
print(sms)
